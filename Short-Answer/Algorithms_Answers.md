#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) The runtime complexity is linear O(n).


b) The runtime complexity is linear of 2* O(n).


c) Runtime complexity is linear of O(n).

## Exercise II

My first thought is to use a binary search to find floor f. I would begin by beginning at the middle floor and dropping the egg. If the egg breaks, got the the halfway point of the bottom, else go to the halfway point of the top. Repeat until floor f is found. Binary search has a runtime complexity of O(log n).
